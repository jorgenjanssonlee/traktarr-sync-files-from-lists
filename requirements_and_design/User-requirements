As a user, I want to...

1. Connect the app to my Trakt.tv account for access to my own, and my friend's, custom watch lists, so it can determine what movies and TV shows are wanted
2. Connect the app to my local Radarr and Sonarr apps, so it can determine what movies and TV shows I have collected
3. Have the app compare a trakt list with my local Radarr and Sonarr collection and create a symlink to the parent folder of the matched item in an output folder, so that the matched item can be synced to an USB drive
4. Configure multiple source lists for multiple trakt accounts, with specific output folder for each combination, so that the app can work on multiple input/ouput scenarios
5. Run the app on a schedule, so I don't have to manually run it
6. Sync symlink folders to a USB drive when attached to the system, so I can transfer the files to another system
X. Have the app automatically refresh the trakt connection token based on expiry date, so I don't have to monitor and redo access config
